# uRTS
uRTS is a tiny, HTML5 canvas real-time strategy game. It was built
entirely on the web &mdash; starting as a
<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/trydionel/p8u5s">jsFiddle</a>,
then graduating to
<a href="http://github.com/trydionel/urts">GitHub</a>
and
<a href="https://c9.io/trydionel/urts">Cloud9</a>
once it was big enough.

## Todo
- Expand terrain generation, especially feature selection (trees, water, rocks)
- Add interesting low-poly meshes. Rendering/shading very important here.
- Build actual RTS UI/UX
- Play with AI, especially Utility Theory (Game Coding Complete, p630)
- Improve pathing -- navmeshes, flocking, "flow fields" (ala SC 2)
- Explore "chunking". Infinite-map sandbox+RTS could be cool.
- Reconsider fog-of-war. Does it make sense in an "infinite" map?
